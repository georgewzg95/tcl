REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 split_rams.ldpc_vn_ram0i/storage_reg has an input control pin split_rams.ldpc_vn_ram0i/storage_reg/ADDRBWRADDR[10] (net: split_rams.ldpc_vn_ram0i/Q[5]) which is driven by a register (varnodes[0].ldpc_vn0i/vnram_wraddr_int_reg[5]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
