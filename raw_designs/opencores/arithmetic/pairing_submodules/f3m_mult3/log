WARNING: [Timing 38-242] The property HD.CLK_SRC of clock port "clk" is not set. In out-of-context mode, this prevents timing estimation for clock delay/skew
Resolution: Set the HD.CLK_SRC property of the out-of-context port to the location of the clock buffer instance in the top-level design

Finished Running Vector-less Activity Propagation
WARNING: [Power 33-332] Found switching activity that implies high-fanout reset nets being asserted for excessive periods of time which may result in inaccurate power analysis.
Resolution: To review and fix problems, please run Power Constraints Advisor in the GUI from Tools > Power Constraints Advisor or run report_power with the -advisory option to generate a text report.
