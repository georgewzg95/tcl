Phase 1 Build RT Design
WARNING: [Route 35-198] Port "Lead" does not have an associated HD.PARTPIN_LOCS, which will prevent the partial routing of the signal "Lead". Without this partial route, timing analysis to/from this port will not be accurate, and no routing information for this port can be exported.
WARNING: [Route 35-198] Port "Lag" does not have an associated HD.PARTPIN_LOCS, which will prevent the partial routing of the signal "Lag". Without this partial route, timing analysis to/from this port will not be accurate, and no routing information for this port can be exported.
WARNING: [Route 35-197] Clock port "MainClock" does not have an associated HD.CLK_SRC. Without this constraint, timing analysis may not be accurate and upstream checks cannot be done to ensure correct clock placement.
