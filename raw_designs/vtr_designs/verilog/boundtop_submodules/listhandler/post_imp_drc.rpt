2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net datain_reg[12]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin datain_reg[12]_i_2/O, cell datain_reg[12]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net next_state is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell FSM_onehot_next_state_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ram/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ram/temp_offset2_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell ram/temp_offset2_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ram/FSM_onehot_state_reg[1][0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ram/temp_lvempty_reg[0]_i_2/O, cell ram/temp_lvempty_reg[0]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ram/FSM_onehot_state_reg[1][1] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ram/temp_lvempty_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell ram/temp_lvempty_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ram/FSM_onehot_state_reg[1][2] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ram/temp_lvempty_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell ram/temp_lvempty_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ram/FSM_onehot_state_reg[1]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ram/temp_offset1_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell ram/temp_offset1_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#8 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ram/FSM_onehot_state_reg[1]_1[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ram/temp_offset0_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell ram/temp_offset0_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#9 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ram/readlevel_reg[1][0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ram/temp_readlevel_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell ram/temp_readlevel_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#10 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net temp_busy_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin temp_busy_reg_i_2/O, cell temp_busy_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#11 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net temp_writelevel_reg[1]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin temp_writelevel_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell temp_writelevel_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
