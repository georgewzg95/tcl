2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net temp_data_reg[63]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin temp_data_reg[63]_i_1/O, cell temp_data_reg[63]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net temp_datavalid_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin temp_datavalid_reg_i_2/O, cell temp_datavalid_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net temp_waddress_reg[17]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin temp_waddress_reg[17]_i_2/O, cell temp_waddress_reg[17]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net tm3_sram_addr_reg[17]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin tm3_sram_addr_reg[17]_i_2/O, cell tm3_sram_addr_reg[17]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net tm3_sram_adsp_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin tm3_sram_adsp_reg_i_2/O, cell tm3_sram_adsp_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net tm3_sram_we_reg[7]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin tm3_sram_we_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell tm3_sram_we_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net want_addr_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin want_addr_reg_i_2/O, cell want_addr_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
