Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP or1200_mult_mac/mul_prod output or1200_mult_mac/mul_prod/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#2 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP or1200_mult_mac/mul_prod__0 output or1200_mult_mac/mul_prod__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#3 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP or1200_mult_mac/mul_prod__1 output or1200_mult_mac/mul_prod__1/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.

DPOP-1#4 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP or1200_mult_mac/mul_prod__2 output or1200_mult_mac/mul_prod__2/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP or1200_mult_mac/mul_prod multiplier stage or1200_mult_mac/mul_prod/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#2 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP or1200_mult_mac/mul_prod__0 multiplier stage or1200_mult_mac/mul_prod__0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0).

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net or1200_cfgr/spr_dat_o_reg[0]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin or1200_cfgr/spr_dat_o_reg[0]_i_1/O, cell or1200_cfgr/spr_dat_o_reg[0]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

RTSTAT-10#1 Warning
No routable loads  
211 net(s) have no routable loads. The problem bus(es) and/or net(s) are or1200_operandmuxes/dcpu_adr_o[2], or1200_operandmuxes/dcpu_adr_o[3], or1200_operandmuxes/dcpu_adr_o[4], or1200_operandmuxes/dcpu_adr_o[5], or1200_operandmuxes/dcpu_adr_o[6], or1200_operandmuxes/dcpu_adr_o[7], or1200_operandmuxes/dcpu_adr_o[8], or1200_operandmuxes/dcpu_adr_o[9], or1200_operandmuxes/dcpu_adr_o[10], or1200_operandmuxes/dcpu_adr_o[11], or1200_operandmuxes/dcpu_adr_o[12], or1200_operandmuxes/dcpu_adr_o[13], or1200_operandmuxes/dcpu_adr_o[14], or1200_operandmuxes/dcpu_adr_o[15], or1200_operandmuxes/dcpu_adr_o[16] (the first 15 of 116 listed).

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
