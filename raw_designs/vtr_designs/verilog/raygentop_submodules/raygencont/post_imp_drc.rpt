2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net temp_active_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin temp_active_reg_i_2/O, cell temp_active_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net temp_addr_reg[1]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin temp_addr_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell temp_addr_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net temp_busyout_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin temp_busyout_reg_i_2/O, cell temp_busyout_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
