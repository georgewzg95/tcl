2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 u0/ram_reg has an input control pin u0/ram_reg/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: u0/Q[6]) which is driven by a register (rp_reg[6]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1840#2 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 u0/ram_reg has an input control pin u0/ram_reg/ADDRARDADDR[11] (net: u0/Q[7]) which is driven by a register (rp_reg[7]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis.
