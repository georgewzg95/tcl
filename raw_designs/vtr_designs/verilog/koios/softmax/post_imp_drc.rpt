Net pre_sub/sub5/u_FPAddSub/NormalizeShift1/Lvl2_reg[16]_i_1__37_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin pre_sub/sub5/u_FPAddSub/NormalizeShift1/Lvl2_reg[16]_i_1__37/O, cell pre_sub/sub5/u_FPAddSub/NormalizeShift1/Lvl2_reg[16]_i_1__37. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
