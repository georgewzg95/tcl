DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP mode3_exp/exp0/Mult_out_reg_reg multiplier stage mode3_exp/exp0/Mult_out_reg_reg/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#2 Warning

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net mode1_max/cmp0_stage0/gt_reg_i_2__2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin mode1_max/cmp0_stage0/gt_reg_i_2__2/O, cell mode1_max/cmp0_stage0/gt_reg_i_2__2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
