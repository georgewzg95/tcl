WARNING: [Route 35-197] Clock port "ap_clk" does not have an associated HD.CLK_SRC. Without this constraint, timing analysis may not be accurate and upstream checks cannot be done to ensure correct clock placement.
WARNING: [Route 35-198] Port "ap_start" does not have an associated HD.PARTPIN_LOCS, which will prevent the partial routing of the signal "ap_start". Without this partial route, timing analysis to/from this port will not be accurate, and no routing information for this port can be exported.
WARNING: [Route 35-198] Port "start_full_n" does not have an associated HD.PARTPIN_LOCS, which will prevent the partial routing of the signal "start_full_n". Without this partial route, timing analysis to/from this port will not be accurate, and no routing information for this port can be exported.
WARNING: [Route 35-198] Port "ap_rst" does not have an associated HD.PARTPIN_LOCS, which will prevent the partial routing of the signal "ap_rst". Without this partial route, timing analysis to/from this port will not be accurate, and no routing information for this port can be exported.
WARNING: [Route 35-198] Port "ap_continue" does not have an associated HD.PARTPIN_LOCS, which will prevent the partial routing of the signal "ap_continue". Without this partial route, timing analysis to/from this port will not be accurate, and no routing information for this port can be exported.
WARNING: [Route 35-198] Port "indices_2_out1_full_n" does not have an associated HD.PARTPIN_LOCS, which will prevent the partial routing of the signal "indices_2_out1_full_n".
