ERROR: [Place 30-640] Place Check : This design requires more Slice LUTs cells than are available in the target device. This design requires 115676 of such cell types but only 53200 compatible sites are available in the target device. Please analyze your synthesis results and constraints to ensure the design is mapped to Xilinx primitives as expected. If so, please consider targeting a larger device. Please set tcl parameter "drc.disableLUTOverUtilError" to 1 to change this error to warning.
